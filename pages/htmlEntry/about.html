            <p>
                I am Software Developer based on Baguio City, Benguet Philippines , I do both desktop application and web application also mobile app. 
                I create solutions align to client's limitless suggestions and revisions to their application they wanted. I have more 
                practices on web development because with my past experience from 456 hours of OJT in government plus 
                2 years in hotel company. Well I do have idea on desktop development because I developed many school 
                project related once and some are successfully launched to certain customer but eventually the apps are majority 
                not used maybe because of credibility. Well who would accept or accredit a DTR system if the time entry is allowed 
                to be customized anyway, but that was my past college days.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do have earn and learn professional ethics on development as software developer in a famous hotel. But I don't majority work on
                a group project. Because in the first job I have, one project always handle by single staff only, Its a working fullstack because 
                not only you construct the documentation but also you construct the UI/UX. You do the backend and setup the database for data entry.
                All task is yours, no dev-ops managing it, even quality assurance is yours, then many addons and endless revisions. Thats my exposure experience.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well I don't have complaints why I choose this career to the things I work on because I know my reason why I want programming and that is 
                creating solution to ideas and suggestions of the clients, because "Programmers makes users life easier" 
                (This is quote from my teacher). Well I want actually in touch on technologies like robotics
                but my purpose is more on creating apps to make operation seamless, faster, informative and productive.
